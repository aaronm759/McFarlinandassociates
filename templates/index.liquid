            I have done many things in my lifetime.  I spent 25 years as an educator.  During those years, I was a testing coordinator, advisor, and organization president.  As the president of the Newark Association of Mathematics Educators, I strived to advance the organizations mission, to develop studentsâ€™ interest in STEM through mathematical competitions, by introducing scholarships, and conducting the first bilingual math competition.  During my last years in education I began to transition to the financial services industry.  I now use those same innovative skills to help create plans for my clients to achieve their financial goals and dreams.</p>
